I created the ConsoleCalculator to sharpen my C# skills.

## About

ConsoleCalculator is a simple command-line calculator built in C#.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.  
You can also reuse the previous calculation result for your next operation.

---

## Features

- Supports operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^` (power).
- Stores the previous result in memory to reuse with the `M` command.
- Handles division by zero gracefully by showing an error message.
- Simple, interactive console interface.
- Allows repeated calculations until the user types `exit`.
